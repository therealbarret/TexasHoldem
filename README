README

This program emulates a game of Texas Hold'em.  There is a max of 4 players with the 5th player being the 'bank' or 'dealer'.
Each player is assigned a name after the deck has been dealt.  There is a hand evaluation running to compare each player hands
to what is dealt.  

Improvements to be made: 

1) Decidiing a winner
2) Possible bank for each player 

No GUI is available as this is only through command line/output window of IDE.
